Developed a temperature measurement system using an Arduino microcontroller, a DS18B20 temperature sensor, an RTC module, and an SD card reader.. The system reads the temperature every minute for 24 hours and logs the data onto an SD card. Once the system is powered on, it will automatically start reading and logging the temperature every minute. The data will be saved in a .txt file on the SD card, formatted with timestamps for each reading.
